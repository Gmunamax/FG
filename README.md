**The FG project.**


# INTRODUCTION

FG is a game inspired by FNAF about a guy who works in a warehouse with robots

I want this game to have a huge ammount of various controls, much more than in fnaf 7. Huge camera system, unusual walking, a lot of mechanics... A game for those people who beat 50/20 or for professional pianists.
Also while I will making this game I will learn a lot about different special unusual things in programming. So, the second purpose of this project is for me.

While I don't know well how to use github here will be all files of this project. It is:

1) FG engine
2) FG
3) Some other stuff


For now here is a demo of engine. Game itself will be coded later.


# BUILD

FG uses libraries that listed below:

* SDL2
* GL
* GLEW

You need these dependences install them to launch this application. With RPM/DNF you can type this command:

	sudo dnf install SDL2
	sudo dnf install glew

GL (OpenGL) is provided by your graphics card driver


To build app from source code you need to install also development files. On RPM/DNF distros usually these packages have "-devel" suffix. So, these commands should look like this:

	sudo dnf install SDL2-devel
	sudo dnf install glew-devel

dev files for GL (OpenGL) should be provided by your graphics card driver or by distro, idk
